/// Represents a position in a particular room in Screeps, stored in Rust
/// memory.
///
/// Use [`RoomPosition`] if a reference to an object stored in JavaScript memory
/// is preferred.
///
/// This should be a very efficient type to use in most if not all situations.
/// It's represented by a single `u32`, all math operations are implemented in
/// pure-Rust code, and uploading to / downloading from JavaScript only requires
/// transferring a single `i32`.
///
/// # Using Position
///
/// You can retrieve a `Position` by getting the position of a game object using
/// [`HasPosition::pos`], or by creating one from coordinates with
/// [`Position::new`].
///
/// You can use any of the math methods available on this page to manipulate
/// [`Position`], and you can pass it to any game methods expecting a position
/// or something with a position.
///
/// # Serialization
///
/// `Position` implements both `serde::Serialize` and
/// `serde::Deserialize`.
///
/// When serializing, it will use the format `{roomName: String, x: u32, y:
/// u32}` in "human readable" formats like JSON, and will serialize as a single
/// `i32` in "non-human readable" formats like [`bincode`].
///
/// If you need a reference to a `RoomPosition` in JavaScript,
/// convert the native [`Position`] to a [`RoomPosition`]:
///
/// ```no_run
/// use screeps::{Position, RoomCoordinate, RoomPosition};
/// use std::convert::TryFrom;
///
/// let pos = Position::new(
///     RoomCoordinate::try_from(20).unwrap(),
///     RoomCoordinate::try_from(21).unwrap(),
///     "E5N6".parse().unwrap(),
/// );
/// let js_pos = RoomPosition::from(pos);
/// let result = js_pos.room_name();
/// ```
///
/// # Deserialization
///
/// `Position` implements `TryFrom<Value>`, allowing conversion from values
/// retrieved from JavaScript. The implementation is fairly lenient, and will
/// try to accept the value as any of the following things, in order:
///
/// - an integer representing the packedPos
///   - this can be produced by retrieving the `__packedPos` field of a
///     `RoomPosition`
/// - an object with a `__packedPos` property
///   - this allows converting from a JavaScript `RoomPosition` to a `Position`
///     without referencing `__packedPos` manually, but is less efficient since
///     it requires an extra callback into JavaScript to grab that field from
///     within the conversion code
/// - an object with `x`, `y` and `roomName` properties
///   - this is mainly intended to decode `Position`s which were previously sent
///     to JavaScript using `@{}` in `js!{}`, or serialized using
///     [`serde::Serialize`]
///   - this will also understand `RoomPosition`s in private servers versions
///     `3.2.1` and below, prior to when `__packedPos` was added
///
/// # World vs. in-room coordinates
///
/// When converting `Position` to integer x/y coordinates, there are two main
/// methods. The first is to use `x`/`y` as "in room" coordinates, which are
/// bounded within `0..=49`. These coordinates only identify the location within
/// a given room name. These are used by [`Position::x`], [`Position::y`],
/// [`Position::new`] as well as [`Position::coords`],
/// [`Position::coords_signed`] and the various implementations of `Into<([ui*],
/// [ui*])>` for `Position`.
///
/// The second is to use `x`/`y` as "world" coordinates, which are coordinates
/// spread across the world. To ensures they agree with in-room coordinates,
/// south is positive `y`, north is negative `y`, east is positive `x` and west
/// is negative `x`. One way to think of them is as extending the room
/// coordinates of the room `E0S0` throughout the entire map.
///
/// World coordinates are used by [`Position::world_x`], [`Position::world_y`],
/// [`Position::world_coords`], [`Position::from_world_coords`], and by all
/// implementations which allow adding or subtracting positions (see [Addition
/// and subtraction](#addition-and-subtraction)).
///
/// # Method Behavior
///
/// While this corresponds with the JavaScript [`RoomPosition`] type, it is not
/// identical. In particular, all "calculation" methods which take in another
/// position are re-implemented in pure Rust code, and some behave slightly
/// different.
///
/// For instance, [`Position::get_range_to`] operates on positions as world
/// coordinates, and will return accurate distances for positions in different
/// rooms. This is in contrast to `RoomPosition.getRangeTo` in JavaScript, which
/// will return `Infinity` for positions from different rooms.
/// [`Position::in_range_to`] has a similar difference.
///
/// Besides extending behavior to work between rooms, we've tried to keep
/// methods as in-sync with the JavaScript versions as possible. Everything
/// will "just work", and there should be some speed advantage because of not
/// having to call into JavaScript to perform calculations.
///
/// # Addition and subtraction
///
/// [`Position`] implements `Add<(i32, i32)>`, `Sub<(i32, i32)>` and
/// `Sub<Position>`. All of these implementations work on positions as world
/// positions, and will treat positions from different rooms just as if they're
/// further apart.
///
/// The `Add` implementation can be used to add an offset to a position:
///
/// ```
/// # use std::convert::TryFrom;
/// # use screeps::{Position, RoomCoordinate};
/// let pos1 = Position::new(
///     RoomCoordinate::try_from(0).unwrap(),
///     RoomCoordinate::try_from(0).unwrap(),
///     "E1N1".parse().unwrap(),
/// );
/// let pos2 = Position::new(
///     RoomCoordinate::try_from(40).unwrap(),
///     RoomCoordinate::try_from(20).unwrap(),
///     "E1N1".parse().unwrap(),
/// );
/// assert_eq!(pos1 + (40, 20), pos2);
/// ```
///
/// And the `Sub` implementation can be used to get the offset between two
/// positions:
///
/// ```
/// # use std::convert::TryFrom;
/// # use screeps::{Position, RoomCoordinate};
/// let pos1 = Position::new(
///     RoomCoordinate::try_from(4).unwrap(),
///     RoomCoordinate::try_from(20).unwrap(),
///     "E20S21".parse().unwrap(),
/// );
/// let pos2 = Position::new(
///     RoomCoordinate::try_from(4).unwrap(),
///     RoomCoordinate::try_from(30).unwrap(),
///     "E20S22".parse().unwrap(),
/// );
/// assert_eq!(pos2 - pos1, (0, 60));
///
/// let pos3 = Position::new(
///     RoomCoordinate::try_from(0).unwrap(),
///     RoomCoordinate::try_from(0).unwrap(),
///     "E20S21".parse().unwrap(),
/// );
/// assert_eq!(pos3 - pos1, (-4, -20));
/// ```
///
/// # Ordering
///
/// To facilitate use as a key in a [`BTreeMap`] or other similar data
/// structures, `Position` implements [`PartialOrd`] and [`Ord`].
///
/// `Position`s are ordered first by ascending world `y` position, then by
/// ascending world `x` position. World `x` and `y` here simply extend the x,y
/// coords within the room `E0S0` throughout the map.
///
/// Looking at positions as tuples `(world_x, world_y)`, the sorting obeys rules
/// such as:
///
/// - `(a, 0) < (b, 1)` for any `a`, `b`
/// - `(0, c) < (1, c)` for any `c`
///
/// This follows left-to-right reading order when looking at the Screeps map
/// from above.
