//! The main interface to objects in the Screeps game world.
//!
//! This contains all functionality from the `Game` object in Screeps. That
//! generally means all state which is true this tick throughout the world.
//!
//! # Safety
//!
//! All returned game objects must be used only during the tick they are
//! retreived or resolved. They are considered "stale" on subsequent ticks, and
//! the behavior of stale game objects is undefined.
