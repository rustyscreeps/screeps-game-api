//! Typed bindings to the Screeps in-game API for WASM Rust AIs.
//!
//! # Cargo Features
//!
//! ## `sim`
//!
//! Enables special-case handling of the unique room name present in the
//! simulator - must be enabled to build code that is compatible with that
//! environment. If this is enabled, the top-left valid room coordinate has the
//! name `sim`, otherwise it's named `W127N127`.
//!
//! ## `generate-pixel`
//!
//! Enables the function to generate pixels, which is only present on the
//! Screeps: World official servers.
//!
//! ## `inter-shard-memory`
//!
//! Enables interacting with `IntershardMemory`, which is not present in most
//! private server environments.
//!
//! ## `score`
//!
//! Enables the score resource and entities, introduced for Screeps Seasonal's
//! first season.
//!
//! ## `symbols`
//!
//! Enables the symbol resources and entities, introduced for Screeps Seasonal's
//! second season.
//!
//! ## `thorium`
//!
//! Enables the thorium resource and reactor object, introduced for Screeps
//! Seasonal's fifth season.
//!
//! ## `unsafe-return-conversion`
//!
//! Enables return code conversion from game functions that presumes all return
//! code values are in the expected ranges skipping checks, and risks undefined
//! behavior if they are not.
//!
//! ## `mmo`
//!
//! Enables the `generate-pixel` and `inter-shard-memory` features, which are
//! present on the Screeps: World official servers but not on private servers.
//!
//! ## `seasonal-season-1`
//!
//! Enables the `score` feature, a mechanic introduced for Screeps Seasonal's
//! first season, as well as enabling constants relevant to season 1.
//!
//! ## `seasonal-season-2`
//!
//! Enables the `symbols` feature, a mechanic introduced for Screeps Seasonal's
//! second season, as well as enabling constants relevant to season 2.
//!
//! ## `seasonal-season-5`
//!
//! Enables the `thorium` feature, a mechanic introduced for Screeps Seasonal's
//! fifth season, as well as enabling constants relevant to season 5.
