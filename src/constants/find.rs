//! Constants for use with the [`Room::find`] function.
//!
//! *Note:* Types in this module have purposefully ambiguous names, and are
//! intended to be used as, for example, `find::CREEPS`, not `CREEPS`.
//!
//! You can do this my importing the module itself, rather than any individual
//! constant, and then just referring to the constants relative to the module.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use screeps::{find, game, Room};
//!
//! let room: Room = game::rooms::get("E23S55".parse().unwrap()).unwrap();
//!
//! let creeps = room.find(find::CREEPS);
//! # let _ = creeps;
//! ```
//!
//! [`Room::find`]: crate::Room::find
//! [`objects::RoomObject`]: crate::RoomObject
