//! Interface for Screeps [`RawMemory`] global object.
//!
//! This is available as an alternative to the `Memory` object in the js heap,
//! which itself is just a light wrapper around serializing into and
//! deserializing JSON into [`RawMemory`]. String data stored can be retrieved
//! after the running bot code is restarted (either by the server or by a new
//! version of the code being uploaded) and decoded using serde or another
//! option.
//!
//! Also contains functions for accessing memory segments and other
//! players' active foreign segments.
