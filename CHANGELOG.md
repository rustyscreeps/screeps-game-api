0.12.0 (2023-06-07)
===================

### Breaking:

  all of their contents re-exported to maintain compatibiltiy with existing imports

0.11.0 (2023-05-29)
===================

### Breaking:

- Move `crate::inter_shard_memory::InterShardMemory::*` to `crate::inter_shard_memory::*` and move
  `crate::raw_memory::RawMemory::*` to `crate::raw_memory::*` for consistency
- Update `enum-iterator` to 1.4 (`IntoEnumIterator` trait replaced with `Sequence`)
- Remove re-exports of `game::*`, `pathfinder::*`, and `raw_memory::*` to resolve name conflict
  and simplify crate namespace

- Update `serde-wasm-bindgen` to 0.5

0.10.0 (2023-03-13)
===================

### Notably breaking:

- Convert from stdweb to wasm-bindgen as underlying framework. While extensive effort was put into
  keeping the API as similar as possible to prior versions, breaking changes are present
  throughout the API as well as associated representations, such as resource types' serialized
  values; bots still using stdweb APIs should target version 0.9.

0.9.1 (2022-09-08)
==================

- Fixed `Room::serialize_path` and `Room::deserialize_path`, which are static methods and don't
  exist on instances of `Room` objects themselves
- Changed `BuildEvent` to match what's returned by the game, which doesn't match the documentation
- Add the `generate-pixel`, `inter-shard-memory`, and `score` features which enable features not
  present in all server environments
- Add the `mmo` feature which activates the `generate-pixel` and `inter-shard-memory` because
  these interfaces don't exist on private servers
- Add the `seasonal-season-1` feature for season 1, which activates the `score` feature
- Add the `symbols` feature to support season 2
- Add the `seasonal-season-2` feature for season 2, which activates the `symbols` feature

0.9.0 (2021-01-23)
==================

### Notably breaking:

- Change `game::inter_shard_memory::get_local` and `get_remote` to return `Option<String>`,
  accounting for cases where they have not been set (breaking)
- Remove `constants::INVADER_CORE_EXPAND_TIME`, replaced by per-level
  `constants::invader_core_expand_time`
- Add the ability to mark a room as impassable when using the pathfinder. Converts callback
  functions for room cost to use `SingleRoomCostResult` and `MultiRoomCostResult` as appropriate

### Additions:

- Add `AccountPowerCreep::cancel_delete`, which allows cancelling pending deletion of a power
  creep
- Add `StructureType::controller_structures`, which translates the `CONTROLLER_STRUCTURES`
  constant, the number of each structure allowed at a given RCL
- Add missing `constants::MARKET_MAX_ORDERS`, `constants::MARKET_ORDER_LIFE_TIME`, and
  `constants::HARVEST_DEPOSIT_POWER`
- Add the `parse_display::Display` trait to type constant enums which currently implement
  `parse_display::FromStr`, allowing reversal of the conversion from native to constant string
- Add new `IntershardResourceType::CPUUnlock`, `IntershardResourceType::Pixel`, and
  `IntershardResourceType::AccessKey` resources
- Add `game::cpu::generate_pixel` and `constants::PIXEL_CPU_COST`

- Change `game::inter_shard_memory` functions to avoid panicking on private servers where the
  interface doesn't exist
- Update `constants::stronghold_rampart_hits` function with updated values from rebalancing
- Corrected value of `constants::RAMPART_HITS_MAX_RCL5` and `constants::POWER_SPAWN_HITS`
- Fixed `Position::get_direction_to` which always returned the opposite of what it should
- Fixed deserialization of `EVENT_POWER` and `EVENT_TRANSFER` events

0.8.0 (2020-05-30)
==================

### Notably breaking:

- Remove deprecated `game::map::is_room_available`, use new `get_room_status` instead
- Move creep functions which are implemented identically on power creeps to `SharedCreepProperties`
  trait
- Update integer representation of `IntershardResource::SubscriptionToken` to move out of conflict
  with normal resources to allow parsing market orders which might have either
- Update `game::market` functions to be able to work with intershard orders and transactions for
  them, making `RoomName` optional in many cases as it's not used for intershard transactions
- Update field visibility on `game::market` structs used as return values to public, update to
  native types for `ResourceType` and `RoomName` values, and make a number of fields optional for
  compatibility with intershard orders
- Update `game::market::create_order` to use the currently documented object syntax and new
  `MarketResourceType` to specify resource
- Update `game::market::calc_transaction_cost` to work with `RoomName` instead of `&Room` to
  avoid requiring visibility of both rooms
- Change `game::map::describe_exits` to use `RoomName` instead of `String` for values
- Remove `StructurePowerSpawn::power` and `power_capacity` (replaced with `HasStore` functions)
- Remove explicitly implemented `Creep::energy` function which used deprecated `.carry`, now
  using the `energy` implementation from `HasStore`
- Change `RoomObjectProperties::room` to return `Option<Room>` to handle the cases that the base
  game API leaves it undefined: for construction sites and flags in non-visible rooms
- Add `MarketResourceType` enum, which can wrap either a `ResourceType` or `IntershardResourceType`
  and switch to using it for `game::market` endpoints which accept either type
- Change `StructureTerminal::send` to take the destination room name as `RoomName` instead of
  `&str`
- Change `game::market::get_all_orders` to accept an `Option<MarketResourceType>` as a filter
  since this is optimized in the server code
- Change `HasStore::store_free_capacity` to return `i32`, handling potential negative values due
  to expiration of `OPERATE_STORAGE`
- Change `constants::GCL_POW` to f64 from f32 due to slightly incorrect calculations when using
  this from f32 to calculate GCL levels
- Remove explicit `ticks_to_decay` implementations on `StructureContainer` and `Tombstone`, use
  the implementation on `CanDecay` instead
- Change `game::cpu::limit`, `tick_limit`, `bucket`, `shard_limits`, and `set_shard_limits` to
  use `u32` from `f64`

### Additions:

- Add `RoomVisual`, rendering primitives (`Circle`, `Line`, `Rect`, `Poly`, `Text`).
- Add Visual rendering primitive enum for storage and batching.
- Add `MoveToOptions::visualize_path_style`to allow for path visualization of movement system.
- Add `ResourceType::reaction_components` function translating the `REACTIONS` constant

  `COMMODITIES` constant
- Add `ResourceType::boost` function translating the `BOOSTS` constant
- Add `game::map::get_room_status` as interface to new `Game.map.getRoomStatus` function
- Add `StructureLab::reverse_reaction` as interface to new `reverseReaction`
- Add `effects` to room objects, allowing access to the effects applied on room objects which
  are used by both strongholds and power creeps.  New `EffectType` enum returned by this call
  represents the `NaturalEffectType` (for stronghold effects) or `PowerType` (for power creeps)
- Add `game::gpl::level`, `game::gpl::progress` and `game::gpl::progress_total`
- Add `StructureController::is_power_enabled`
- Add `game::power_creeps` access, which returns a special `AccountPowerCreep` reference due
  to the fact that these power creeps may not be spawned on the current shard and allow spawning.
  Use `AccountPowerCreep::get_power_creep` which returns `Option<PowerCreep>` to get the living
  power creep, if spawned on the current shard.
- Add `PowerCreepClass` enum to represent power creep classes, currently only `Operator`
- Add `game::market::get_history` and `game::market::OrderHistoryRecord` exposing new
  `getHistory` API function
- Add `Creep::move_pulled_by` which allows a creep to accept another creep's attempt to `pull`
- Add `SearchOptions::max_cost` to limit the maximum path cost for pathfinder searches
- Add `RoomTerrain::get_raw_buffer_to_array` to load a room's terrain into an existing `[u8; 2500]`
- Add `game::gcl::total_for_level` and `game::gpl::total_for_level` which calculate the total
  lifetime points required for a given level of GCL or GPL
- Add `CostMatrixSet` trait to allow applying costs to a cost matrix generically

### Bugfixes:

- Fix `Room::find_path` function call to underlying javascript
- Fix typo in `Position::create_named_construction_site` and work around screeps bug in
  `Room::create_named_construction_site` by passing x and y instead of position object
- Fix javascript associated object name for `StructureSpawn::spawning`
- Correct swapped return types for `Mineral::density` and `Mineral::mineral_amount` and add
  a workaround for some private servers returning floating point `mineralAmount` values
- Fix typo in `StructureController::reservation` ticks_to_end return value
- Fix reversed conversion of `TOUGH` and `HEAL` parts
- Fix `OwnedStructureProperties::has_owner` to correctly return false for unowned structures
- Work around a case where `map::describe_exits` would panic when a private server returns null
  for an unavailable room
- Change `Source` and `Mineral` `ticks_to_regeneration` functions to return 0, preventing panics
  in cases where the game API returns negative or undefined values
- Fix visibility of struct fields on `MapRoomStatus` and `RoomRouteStep`
- Add `total_available_size` field to `game::cpu::HeapStatistics`
- Add missed `StructureFactory::level` function to determine a factory's level (or `None` if a
  power creep has not yet used `OPERATE_FACTORY`)
- Change `pathfinder::search_many` to return an incomplete result when called with no goals to
  prevent a panic due to unexpected return data from javascript.
- Change `MemoryReference::get` to return a generic error type
- Change `StructureLab::mineral_type` to return `Option<ResourceType>`, avoiding panic when labs
  are empty

### Misc:

- Update `StructureTower::attack` and `heal` to allow targeting power creeps, and update
  `repair` to accept `StructureProperties` matching `Creep::repair`
- Update `Creep::heal` and `ranged_heal` to target anything with the `SharedCreepProperties`
  trait to allow use on power creeps

0.7.0 (2019-10-19)
==================

### Notably breaking:

- Remove `CanStoreEnergy` trait, moving all structures and creeps to `HasStore`, migrating from
  deprecated Screeps API endpoints to new `.store` API (breaking)
    - Remove `Creep::carry_total`, `Creep::carry_types`, `Creep::carry_of`
    - Remove `StructureLab::mineral_amount`, `StructureLab::mineral_capacity`
    - Remove `StructureNuker::ghodium`, `StructureNuker::ghodium_capacity`
    - Change `HasStore::store_capacity` to use new API and now takes `Option<ResourceType>`
    - Add `HasStore::store_free_capacity` and `HasStore::store_used_capacity`, which both
    take `Option<ResourceType>`
- Change return type of `game::rooms::keys` from `Vec<String>` to `Vec<RoomName>`
- Change `HasCooldown` trait to apply to objects with `RoomObjectProperties` instead of
  `StructureProperties` due to addition of `Deposit` objects
- Fix `Position::in_range_to` to be inclusive, to match documentation and JS behavior

### Additions:

- Add new `StructureFactory` and `StructureInvaderCore` structure types
- Add a number of new constants related to factory operation and strongholds
- Add new resource types for factory commodities
- Add `Deposit` objects and related find/look constants
- Add `Ruin` objects and related find/look constants
- Change `Creep.harvest` to work with any harvestable object type; `Deposit`, `Mineral`, and
  `Source`
- Add `ObjectId<T>`, a typed binary object ID, and `RawObjectId`, an untyped binary object ID
  - untyped ids can be converted to typed freely - the type is purely for type inference
  - `RoomObject::id` now returns `ObjectId<Self>`, and an `untyped_id` function is added for
    retrieving an untyped id
  - `game::get_object_typed` now takes `ObjectId<T>`, and `game::get_object_erased` is now generic,
    taking either id type
  - both types are 12 bytes large, and can represent all hex-formatted object IDs from the official
    server, the default private servers backend and the private server with ags131's mongodb mod
- Add support for accessing intershard resource amounts, which currently only includes subscription
  tokens, under `game::resources`.
- Implement `PartialOrd` and `Ord` for `Position`, `RoomName`, `RawObjectId` and `ObjectId`. See
  documentation for ordering specifications.

- Rename incorrectly spelled `Nuke::lauch_room_name` to `launch_room_name`.
- Rename constants with typo `SPAWN_RENEW_RATION` and  `LINK_LOSS_RATION` to `SPAWN_RENEW_RATIO`
  and `LINK_LOSS_RATIO` respectively

### Misc:

- Add a number of modules grouping constants together, such as `constants::creep` for creep related
  constants or `constants::minerals` for mineral related constants.
- Remove remaining usages of internal `get_from_js!` macro, as it was minimally useful
- Improve syntax and consistency of some internal macros

0.6.0 (2019-08-15)

    coordinates, and has methods like `from_world_coords` and `world_coords`. See [`Position`
    documentation][pos-doc].
- Merge `LocalRoomPosition` and `RoomPosition` into one efficient, local, `Position` type. (#206)
  - Game methods dealing with coordinates now take something which can produce a local

- Work around bug where IntelliJ-Rust didn't understand `screeps::game::*` modules created by a
  macro, even with experimental engine enabled (#197)
- `OwnedStructureProperties`'s `my` method now correctly handles the value being undefined.
  This fixes a panic on checking `my` for unowned controllers (#189)
- `StructurePortal` no longer implements `OwnedStructure` and `Attackable`. (#190)
- Collections provided by `Game` now implement the `hashmap` function to retrieve both keys
  and values at once. (#194)

0.5.0 (2019-07-19)
==================

- `Serialize` and `Deserialize` format changed for most constants and for `LocalRoomPosition`
  (breaking)
  - constants now always serialize as integers (see
    [the module doc](https://docs.rs/screeps-game-api/0.5/screeps/constants/index.html)) (#164)
  - `LocalRoomPosition` will now serialize differently depending on whether the format is readable
    (see the [`LocalRoomPosition`
    doc](https://docs.rs/screeps-game-api/0.5/screeps/struct.LocalRoomPosition.html)) (#171)
- `constants-serde` feature removed in favor of always implementing Serialize and Deserialize for
  constants. (#164)
