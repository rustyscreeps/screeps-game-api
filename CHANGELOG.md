Unreleased
==========

- Fixed `Room::serialize_path` and `Room::deserialize_path`, which are static methods and don't
  exist on instances of `Room` objects themselves.

0.9.0 (2021-01-23)
==================

### Notably breaking:

- Change `game::inter_shard_memory::get_local` and `get_remote` to return `Option<String>`,
  accounting for cases where they have not been set (breaking)
- Remove `constants::INVADER_CORE_EXPAND_TIME`, replaced by per-level
  `constants::invader_core_expand_time`
- Add the ability to mark a room as impassable when using the pathfinder. Converts callback
  functions for room cost to use `SingleRoomCostResult` and `MultiRoomCostResult` as appropriate.

### Additions:

- Add `AccountPowerCreep::cancel_delete`, which allows cancelling pending deletion of a power
  creep
- Add `StructureType::controller_structures`, which translates the `CONTROLLER_STRUCTURES`
  constant, the number of each structure allowed at a given RCL
- Add missing `constants::MARKET_MAX_ORDERS`, `constants::MARKET_ORDER_LIFE_TIME`, and
  `constants::HARVEST_DEPOSIT_POWER`
- Add the `parse_display::Display` trait to type constant enums which currently implement
  `parse_display::FromStr`, allowing reversal of the conversion from native to constant string
- Add new `IntershardResourceType::CPUUnlock`, `IntershardResourceType::Pixel`, and
  `IntershardResourceType::AccessKey` resources
- Add `game::cpu::generate_pixel` and `constants::PIXEL_CPU_COST`
- Update `constants::PIXEL_CPU_COST` to match game balance change.

### Bugfixes:

- Change `game::inter_shard_memory` functions to avoid panicking on private servers where the
  interface doesn't exist
- Update `constants::stronghold_rampart_hits` function with updated values from rebalancing
- Corrected value of `constants::RAMPART_HITS_MAX_RCL5` and `constants::POWER_SPAWN_HITS`
- Fixed `Position::get_direction_to` which always returned the opposite of what it should
- Fixed deserialization of `EVENT_POWER` and `EVENT_TRANSFER` events

0.8.0 (2020-05-30)
==================

### Notably breaking:

- Remove deprecated `game::map::is_room_available`, use new `get_room_status` instead
- Move creep functions which are implemented identically on power creeps to `SharedCreepProperties`
  trait
- Update integer representation of `IntershardResource::SubscriptionToken` to move out of conflict
  with normal resources to allow parsing market orders which might have either
- Update `game::market` functions to be able to work with intershard orders and transactions for
  them, making `RoomName` optional in many cases as it's not used for intershard transactions
- Update field visibility on `game::market` structs used as return values to public, update to
  native types for `ResourceType` and `RoomName` values, and make a number of fields optional for
  compatibility with intershard orders
- Update `game::market::create_order` to use the currently documented object syntax and new
  `MarketResourceType` to specify resource
- Update `game::market::calc_transaction_cost` to work with `RoomName` instead of `&Room` to
  avoid requiring visibility of both rooms
- Change `game::map::describe_exits` to use `RoomName` instead of `String` for values
- Remove `StructurePowerSpawn::power` and `power_capacity` (replaced with `HasStore` functions)
- Remove explicitly implemented `Creep::energy` function which used deprecated `.carry`, now
  using the `energy` implementation from `HasStore`
- Change `RoomObjectProperties::room` to return `Option<Room>` to handle the cases that the base
  game API leaves it undefined: for construction sites and flags in non-visible rooms
- Add `MarketResourceType` enum, which can wrap either a `ResourceType` or `IntershardResourceType`
  and switch to using it for `game::market` endpoints which accept either type
- Change `StructureTerminal::send` to take the destination room name as `RoomName` instead of
  `&str`
- Change `game::market::get_all_orders` to accept an `Option<MarketResourceType>` as a filter
  since this is optimized in the server code
- Change `HasStore::store_free_capacity` to return `i32`, handling potential negative values due
  to expiration of `OPERATE_STORAGE`
- Change `constants::GCL_POW` to f64 from f32 due to slightly incorrect calculations when using
  this from f32 to calculate GCL levels
- Remove explicit `ticks_to_decay` implementations on `StructureContainer` and `Tombstone`, use
  the implementation on `CanDecay` instead
- Change `game::cpu::limit`, `tick_limit`, `bucket`, `shard_limits`, and `set_shard_limits` to
  use `u32` from `f64`

### Additions:

- Add `RoomVisual`, rendering primitives (`Circle`, `Line`, `Rect`, `Poly`, `Text`).
- Add Visual rendering primitive enum for storage and batching.
- Add `MoveToOptions::visualize_path_style`to allow for path visualization of movement system.
- Add `ResourceType::reaction_components` function translating the `REACTIONS` constant
- Add `ResourceType::commodity_recipe` function and `FactoryRecipe` struct translating the
  `COMMODITIES` constant
- Add `ResourceType::boost` function translating the `BOOSTS` constant
- Add `game::map::get_room_status` as interface to new `Game.map.getRoomStatus` function
- Add `StructureLab::reverse_reaction` as interface to new `reverseReaction`
- Add `effects` to room objects, allowing access to the effects applied on room objects which
  are used by both strongholds and power creeps.  New `EffectType` enum returned by this call
  represents the `NaturalEffectType` (for stronghold effects) or `PowerType` (for power creeps)
- Add `game::gpl::level`, `game::gpl::progress` and `game::gpl::progress_total`
- Add `StructureController::is_power_enabled`
- Add `game::power_creeps` access, which returns a special `AccountPowerCreep` reference due
  to the fact that these power creeps may not be spawned on the current shard and allow spawning.
  Use `AccountPowerCreep::get_power_creep` which returns `Option<PowerCreep>` to get the living
  power creep, if spawned on the current shard.
- Add `PowerCreepClass` enum to represent power creep classes, currently only `Operator`
- Add `game::market::get_history` and `game::market::OrderHistoryRecord` exposing new
  `getHistory` API function
- Add `Creep::move_pulled_by` which allows a creep to accept another creep's attempt to `pull`
- Add `SearchOptions::max_cost` to limit the maximum path cost for pathfinder searches
- Add `RoomTerrain::get_raw_buffer_to_array` to load a room's terrain into an existing `[u8; 2500]`
- Add `game::gcl::total_for_level` and `game::gpl::total_for_level` which calculate the total
  lifetime points required for a given level of GCL or GPL
- Add `CostMatrixSet` trait to allow applying costs to a cost matrix generically.

### Bugfixes:

- Fix `Room::find_path` function call to underlying javascript
- Fix typo in `Position::create_named_construction_site` and work around screeps bug in
  `Room::create_named_construction_site` by passing x and y instead of position object
- Fix javascript associated object name for `StructureSpawn::spawning`
- Correct swapped return types for `Mineral::density` and `Mineral::mineral_amount` and add
  a workaround for some private servers returning floating point `mineralAmount` values
- Fix typo in `StructureController::reservation` ticks_to_end return value
- Fix reversed conversion of `TOUGH` and `HEAL` parts
- Fix `OwnedStructureProperties::has_owner` to correctly return false for unowned structures
- Work around a case where `map::describe_exits` would panic when a private server returns null
  for an unavailable room
- Change `Source` and `Mineral` `ticks_to_regeneration` functions to return 0, preventing panics
  in cases where the game API returns negative or undefined values
- Fix visibility of struct fields on `MapRoomStatus` and `RoomRouteStep`
- Add `total_available_size` field to `game::cpu::HeapStatistics`
- Add missed `StructureFactory::level` function to determine a factory's level (or `None` if a
  power creep has not yet used `OPERATE_FACTORY`)
- Change `pathfinder::search_many` to return an incomplete result when called with no goals to
  prevent a panic due to unexpected return data from javascript.
- Change `MemoryReference::get` to return a generic error type
- Change `StructureLab::mineral_type` to return `Option<ResourceType>`, avoiding panic when labs
  are empty

### Misc:

- Update `StructureTower::attack` and `heal` to allow targeting power creeps, and update
  `repair` to accept `StructureProperties` matching `Creep::repair`
- Update `Creep::heal` and `ranged_heal` to target anything with the `SharedCreepProperties`
  trait to allow use on power creeps

0.7.0 (2019-10-19)
==================

### Notably breaking:

- Remove `CanStoreEnergy` trait, moving all structures and creeps to `HasStore`, migrating from
  deprecated Screeps API endpoints to new `.store` API (breaking)
    - Remove `Creep::carry_total`, `Creep::carry_types`, `Creep::carry_of`
    - Remove `StructureLab::mineral_amount`, `StructureLab::mineral_capacity`
    - Remove `StructureNuker::ghodium`, `StructureNuker::ghodium_capacity`
    - Change `HasStore::store_capacity` to use new API and now takes `Option<ResourceType>`
    - Add `HasStore::store_free_capacity` and `HasStore::store_used_capacity`, which both
    take `Option<ResourceType>`
- Change return type of `game::rooms::keys` from `Vec<String>` to `Vec<RoomName>`
- Change `HasCooldown` trait to apply to objects with `RoomObjectProperties` instead of
  `StructureProperties` due to addition of `Deposit` objects
- Fix `Position::in_range_to` to be inclusive, to match documentation and JS behavior

### Additions:

- Add new `StructureFactory` and `StructureInvaderCore` structure types
- Add a number of new constants related to factory operation and strongholds
- Add new resource types for factory commodities
- Add `Deposit` objects and related find/look constants
- Add `Ruin` objects and related find/look constants
- Change `Creep.harvest` to work with any harvestable object type; `Deposit`, `Mineral`, and
  `Source`
- Add `ObjectId<T>`, a typed binary object ID, and `RawObjectId`, an untyped binary object ID
  - untyped ids can be converted to typed freely - the type is purely for type inference
  - `RoomObject::id` now returns `ObjectId<Self>`, and an `untyped_id` function is added for
    retrieving an untyped id
  - `game::get_object_typed` now takes `ObjectId<T>`, and `game::get_object_erased` is now generic,
    taking either id type
  - both types are 12 bytes large, and can represent all hex-formatted object IDs from the official
    server, the default private servers backend and the private server with ags131's mongodb mod
- Add support for accessing intershard resource amounts, which currently only includes subscription
  tokens, under `game::resources`.
- Implement `PartialOrd` and `Ord` for `Position`, `RoomName`, `RawObjectId` and `ObjectId`. See
  documentation for ordering specifications.

### Bugfixes:

- Fix typos in JavaScript code for `game::market::get_order` and `Nuke::launch_room_name`
- Fix `Creep::body` crashing if body contained non-boosted parts
- Fix JS syntax error in `Creep::move_to_with_options`
- Remove usage of internal `stdweb` macros, which break with stdweb version changes
- Rename incorrectly spelled `Density::probabilitiy` to `probability`.
- Rename incorrectly spelled `Nuke::lauch_room_name` to `launch_room_name`.
- Rename constants with typo `SPAWN_RENEW_RATION` and  `LINK_LOSS_RATION` to `SPAWN_RENEW_RATIO`
  and `LINK_LOSS_RATIO` respectively

### Misc:

- Add a number of modules grouping constants together, such as `constants::creep` for creep related
  constants or `constants::minerals` for mineral related constants.
- Remove remaining usages of internal `get_from_js!` macro, as it was minimally useful
- Improve syntax and consistency of some internal macros

0.6.0 (2019-08-15)

  server's optimizations, and implement math utilities for it. (#203)
  - `LocalRoomPosition`, now `Position`, implements `Add<(i32, i32)>` for altering world
    coordinates, and has methods like `from_world_coords` and `world_coords`. See [`Position`
    documentation][pos-doc].
- Merge `LocalRoomPosition` and `RoomPosition` into one efficient, local, `Position` type. (#206)
  - Game methods dealing with coordinates now take something which can produce a local
    `Position`, and will only have to upload a single `u32` to JavaScript to call it.

- Work around bug where IntelliJ-Rust didn't understand `screeps::game::*` modules created by a
  macro, even with experimental engine enabled (#197)
- `OwnedStructureProperties`'s `my` method now correctly handles the value being undefined.
  This fixes a panic on checking `my` for unowned controllers (#189)
- `StructurePortal` no longer implements `OwnedStructure` and `Attackable`. (#190)
- Collections provided by `Game` now implement the `hashmap` function to retrieve both keys
  and values at once. (#194)

  repository
- Mark most constant functions as inlinable (#221)

0.5.0 (2019-07-19)
==================

  (breaking)
  - constants now always serialize as integers (see
    [the module doc](https://docs.rs/screeps-game-api/0.5/screeps/constants/index.html)) (#164)
  - `LocalRoomPosition` will now serialize differently depending on whether the format is readable
    (see the [`LocalRoomPosition`
    doc](https://docs.rs/screeps-game-api/0.5/screeps/struct.LocalRoomPosition.html)) (#171)
- `constants-serde` feature removed in favor of always implementing Serialize and Deserialize for
  constants. (#164)
